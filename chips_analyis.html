    <h1>Chips Sales Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Skylar is a retail store chain specializing in snacks and fast food. Julia, the Head of the Chips Sales Department, reached out for assistance in analyzing data from her section. She is interested in understanding overall sales trends, customer behavior, brand preferences, price sensitivity, and other key insights across all stores between <strong>July 2018 and June 2019</strong>.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, a new product layout was trialed in Stores 77, 86, and 88 from <strong>February to April 2019</strong>. Julia wants to evaluate whether the new layout had any impact on purchasing behavior and overall chip sales performance.
      </p>



    <h2>Overall Aim</h2>
    <p>
        To identify customer segments, product preferences, and pricing behaviors that drive sales, evaluate the performance of trial strategies, and recommend insights that can be scaled across stores.
      </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Segment customers by demographics and purchase behavior</li>
      <li>Determine top-performing products by size and brand</li>
      <li>Assess price sensitivity across customer types</li>
      <li>Identify and match control stores to evaluate trial store performance effectively</li>
      <li>Evaluate trial performance and strategy scalability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Analyst Role</h2>
    <p>
      As the data analyst for this project, my role was to conduct exploratory and statistical analysis on the transaction and customer data, evaluate the performance of the trial layout, and generate actionable insights. The findings were compiled into a comprehensive PowerPoint report to support decision-making.
